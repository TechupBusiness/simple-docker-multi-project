## Upgrade nextcloud
Nextcloud must be upgraded step by step:
Before you can upgrade to the next major release, Nextcloud upgrades to the latest point release.

Then run the upgrade again to upgrade to the next major releaseâ€™s latest point release.

You cannot skip major releases. Please re-run the upgrade until you have reached the highest available (or applicable) release.

Example: 18.0.5 -> 18.0.11 -> 19.0.5 -> 20.0.2

1. Stop cron container `./compose.sh nextcloud stop cron`
1. Update to the next version that can be used according to docs, using `./project.sh nextcloud` and change `NEXTCLOUD_VERSION` to your version (including fpm and alpine)
1. `./compose.sh nextcloud build app`
1. Update from an build: `./compose.sh nextcloud up -d  --no-deps --force-recreate app`
1. Check logs `./compose.sh nextcloud logs -f app`, if it doesnt show that its updating automatically (e.g. errors like php not found) you need to trigger the update manually
